# 🚀 Job Application Tracker

A production-style full-stack web application to **track, manage, and secure job applications** with proper authentication, database design, and backend architecture.

---

## 🔥 Why This Project Exists

Tracking job applications in spreadsheets is inefficient and error-prone.  
This system solves that by providing:

- Centralized tracking  
- Secure user isolation  
- Structured data management  
- Real-world backend practices  

---

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### Authentication System
- Secure user signup & login  
- Password hashing using Werkzeug  
- Session-based authentication  

### Application Management (CRUD)
- Add job applications  
- Edit job details (role, company, status)  
- Delete applications  
- View personalized dashboard  

### User Isolation
- Each user can only access their own data  
- Backend-enforced access control  

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Handles UI and user interaction  
- **Backend (Flask):** Handles routing, authentication, and logic  
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores users and job applications  

**Flow:**
```
User → Frontend → Flask → MySQL → Response → UI
```

## 🔐 Security Design

- Passwords are hashed (`generate_password_hash`)  
- No plaintext credential storage  
- Session-based authentication  
- Environment variables used for:
  - Database credentials  
  - Secret keys  
- `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files  
- Backend validation prevents unauthorized access
